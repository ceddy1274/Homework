# Map Editor in Java

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project was the made up of the first three homework assignments for the Programming Paradigms class. The first assignment was an introduction to Java. The second was to use JSON to create a map editor that could save and load data. The third assignment was to use polymorphism to make a statue strafe, a mushroom grow, and a turtle jump.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
The Java files are all different files needed for the common Model, View, Controller architecture seen in programming. The view is what a user can currently see, the model is what is happening in the entire world of thr program, and the controller is how the program handles inputs from the user. Main.java is what interconnects the model, view, and controller to make the game work. There is also a map.json and folder for images which allows the user to put images onto the screen, save the image positions, and then reload the images which is a common technique used to save the current state of programs. Finally, the run.bash file is a bash script used to make running the program quicker and increase productivity. If on a windows machine (which is what I used), use the run.bat file.
