# Robot Game in Javascript

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project was the made up of three homework assignments for the Programming Paradigms class. The first assignment was to learn about Javascript. The second assignment was to create a game with a client server architecture. The third assignment was to make the game asynchronous and add images to the map. When a client opens the game they will see their robot along with any other users robots within the world. If a user right clicks on the screen they will shoot a fireball. If they hit another players robot they will get a point. However, if they hit another object on the screen they will remove that object from the screen and lose all their points. The screen will move along with the paper so they can move to different parts of the map.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
The game.js is the Javascript file for the client and the server.js is the Javascript file for the server. Client.html is the html page used by the client to display the game. The robot.png is the image file used to display the character and the fireball.png is used to shoot fireballs. The folder of images contains pngs used for the map. Run.bash is a bash script file to run the program, if on Windows(which is what I used) use the run.bat file instead.
