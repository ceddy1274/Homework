# Programming Paradigms Class Description
Programming Paradigms is the third programming class taught at the University of Arkansas. After spending the first two programming classes learning some of the basics of programming in C++, this class focuses on the object oriented programming paradigm in Java, Javascript, and Python. The end goal of the class was to be able to create any simple program you can imagine and to prepare students for upcoming senior level classes and electives which focus on more specialized areas of computer science such as AI, Database Management Systems, Computer Networks, etc. The class touched on concepts such as the model view controller architecture, polymorphism and inheritance, the client-server architecture, asynchronus programming, and basic laws regarding open source software.
