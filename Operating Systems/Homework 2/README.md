# Homework 2
In homework two we explored the use of pipes in C. Pipes are used to share data between two processes. Filecopy.c uses pipes to copy the contents of one file into another using the parent process to write the contents to the pipe and the child process to read the contents of the pipe. String_reverse.c uses two pipes. The first uses the parent to write the original string to the child. The child process uses the second pipe to write the reversed string back to the parent and the parent prints the reversed message after reading from the second pipe.
